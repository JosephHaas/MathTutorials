# MathTutorials
This website is a front-end project for a mathematics tutorial website. 
In this project, I set up the website using HTML5 and CSS3. 
I tend to prefer to use and link an external CSS stylesheet, when developing websites. 
This is so that, 1) My CSS code doesn't get mixed in with HTML, and 2) It isolates the structure of the webpage from the design of it.
